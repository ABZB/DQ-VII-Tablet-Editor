Small program (now with GUI) for adding Haven/DLC tablets
Excel editor for the Monster Meadows/Streetpass tablets

Note that the following Haven tablets will currently not be properly added:

Magooma Mountain
Blimpton
Crockery Crag
Nailbiter's Nook
Return to Slimetree Forest
Heights of Machismo
Boobytrap Bluff
Heroes' Grotto

(I just need to grab a save file that has them to add them)
